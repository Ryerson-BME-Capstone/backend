# Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma Survival Prediction backend

The backend for this project was constructed using Python. Data was was read using Pandas and the dataframes were then manipulated to clean, sort and filter the various data. A neural network model was then built in using Tensorflow to analyze the relationships in the data and apply this to new data for predictions. To relay the results to the frontend FastAPI was used to create the API calls necessary. The backend was finally containerized to be tested locally using Docker.
